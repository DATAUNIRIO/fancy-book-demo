["index.html", "Demo book Prerequisites", " Demo book Desiree De Leon 08/09/2019 Prerequisites This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. This signals a placeholder for when live-coding or another demo is occurring. This signals an activity or challenge for you to try This points out a tip that may be useful for a workflow or process This proves more background in case you’re interesting in knowing more "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

It is called a global chunk option for that reason. You can (and should) use individual chunk options too, but setting up some nice ones that apply to all code chunks can save you time and can lessen your cognitive load as you create your content. 2.3 Two plots side-by-side ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), fill = factor(vs))) + geom_bar(position = position_dodge(preserve = &quot;total&quot;)) ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), fill = factor(vs))) + geom_bar(position = position_dodge2(preserve = &quot;total&quot;)) 2.4 Include verbatim code chunks You may have noticed that the code chunk output, even when echo=TRUE, does not show the actual code chunk options that you see in your .Rmd file.
